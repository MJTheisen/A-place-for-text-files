Check check 1 2 3 
-Git and Github

-Git is the actual version control software.
-Github is a webservice where you can do Git things.
================
-Repository (Repo) is a project with multiple files.
-Commit is like save. has a Hash 
-Branch.
-main list of commits is the master.
-can have a bunch of branches with their own commits.
================
-Pull Request "please take my changes and pull them into main"
-Merge- the merge was successful, no conflicts, made a new branch called "additional branch".
-Adding some information prior to "additional branch" edit .
===============
-Forks - forking a repository. like taking a whole instance and put it under my account.
an exact replica, including history.
-A pull request would be asking the original person that it was forked from, to pull it 
from me and then merge it
-I want to push but i cant so they have to pull
so I ask for a pull request!
